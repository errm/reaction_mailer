# Re-ActionMailer

ReactionMailer is designed to send real emails out using the files
generated by [Inaction Mailer](https://github.com/cwninja/inaction_mailer/)

It will even read emails served up by [PopThis](https://github.com/cwninja/popthis)

Most of the time it is most useful to have a rails app in development
not to send out any actual emails.

However it is usefull to be able to send real emails for things like
testing with [Litmus](http://litmus.com/).

## Installation

Install it:

    $ gem install reaction_mailer

## Usage

    Usage: remail [options] file1 file2 ...
           remail [options] directory
           remail [options] -p
           
    -u, --username USERNAME          Gmail Username
    -w, --password PASSWORD          Gmail Password
    -t, --to EMAIL                   Send the email to who?
    -p, --pop                        Read the emails to send from popthis
    -h, --help                       Display this screen
